Woke up, this morning, on the shores of Lake McClellan. It was completely new sight, as we'd arrived in the dark. Getting in was harrowing, with long stretches of the I-40 under construction, traffic winnowed into one lane, or the other, in some insane cone-wrangled, miles-long semi-truck slalom. Finding an exit was a hair-raising exercise in patience and squinting.

We'd blown straight through Amarillo. I was driving. It's a big town (or a little city) of 200k people. Something like two and a quarter SF Bay Peninsula cities.

Lunch was an under-dressed salad parked in the lot of the only grocer in Tucumcari. That's a funny town, Tucumcari. Real, real run-down, it straddles a good bit of Route 66 and that's told by the funky motels and boarded-up tourist stops. I can only imagine that trundling down Route 66 at one's own speed must've once been a real scene, but now the interstate's blown all that up. There's no reason to stop in Tucumcari, anymore, except if you're deliberately avoiding Amarillo.

I am trying to remember the name of the Edo-period Japanese tourism-themed board game I bought two or three years back. Players assume the role of a pedestrian traveler going along the main road, and score points by purchasing sets of souvenirs, thriftily exploring local cuisine, and meeting colorful strangers on the road. I can't help but see the parallels in our current peregrinations, and I take some satisfaction in considering how well we're scoring. I can't help but think we'd have done better at the height of Route 66, or some such, but of course we couldn't then have done in a month what we're doing now.

Yesterday morning was spent leaving, reluctantly, Santa Fe. We had another tour of the shops around the plaza, striking up a great conversation with a New Orleans transplant to Santa Fe, who raved about that other city's great food, and nightlife. Sam and I put New Orleans on the trip plan pretty late into our machinations, and then stripped it off right before departure: too far South, it'd've been a serious hustle to get to--via San Antonio and Galveston. Of course, with our first week of Eastward progress--and our transmission--knocked out by the winds of fortune, we never gave New Orleans a second thought.  Still, I enjoyed hearing her enthusiasm for the live music, the annual Jazz Fest, dancing and drinking and all that's wonderful about New Orleans.

That's some place I could go back to. But I've certainly drunk deep of it, having been twice myself. Santa Fe tops my list for longer visits, now, and Durango follows closely.

Leaving Santa Fe we stopped for twenty minutes to inflate the tires to their factory-specified PSI. This was a bit of an ordeal, at first, since I'm not so handy with the pen pressure-gauge, and I'd never used the air hose, either. The first place we stopped had an entirely unreadable meter, and the second had no meter at all--but at least it was free.

We've got a wireless, dashboard-mounted Tire-Pressure Moniter System that beeps like crazy if we dip beyond our specified PSI. It hadn't been going off, but looking at the numbers, they seemed a little out-of-whack and I'm keen to keep every little thing ship-shape to avoid cascading failures. An ounce of prevention, they say, is worth a pound of cure. Or an overnight in a mechanic's parking lot.

With the tire pressure maintenance, we're improving mileage, reducing friction with the road (thus lowering tire temperature, which ameliorates wear and lowers the risk of blowouts), and reducing drag on the engine. Keep your tires at the proper pressure, and your engine should run that much cooler, which was a serious consideration of ours in the desert, although here in the plains, punching through a cool, constant Westward headwind, the coolant thermometer needle's been sat squarely on the Cold edge of Normal the whole time. In the afternoon, as the sun dissappeared behind us, it even got a bit brisk in the cab.

We made one other pit stop to empty our waste tanks and fill up on gas at a Flying J station. It's quite novel to use all the amenities at once, there. You can pull up to a special RV gas island that's got all the inlets and outlets you need. You can fill your gas and drinking water while your sewage exits at the other end. I suppose the satisfaction this gives me will, eventually, wear off but for now I relish--inasmuch as I can--the novelty of these chores.

We took a walk, this morning, around Lake McClellan. There were some prarie grasses, robins and turkeys (or grouse?) running about the place. We might've heard a quail but, then again, it could've been a turkey of some kind. I don't know what they sound like out here.

The lake was low. We could see a copse of trees out behind it that must've been an island at one point. So the lake was down to a quarter of its maximum volume. We wondered at how it ran dry, and how it was fed, but maybe there's no mystery to dryness in this part of the country. If the CCC had really built this place as a demonstration of plains conservation to counteract the dustbowl, then its climate is notoriously droughtful. It's a wonder there's a lake at all.

There weren't any hiking trails to speak of--not from sight, and there was no map we could find--but there were several ATV tracks, both up and down some kills and around the lake. I imagine that kind of recreation can be pleasant, but I won't pretend it doesn't irk me that folks feel a need to have a gas-engine do their nature-walking for them. As though the environs themselves aren't enough to occupy their nervous systems; they've got to engage in a little velocity-induced adrenaline, too, or else they derive no value from a National Grasslands. That disappoints me. Can't you engage in that kind of hooliganism anywhere else? You've got to allow for it at nature preserves? Doesn't seem right.
