I will try and write this quickly, because my fingers are a little numb; the wind won't quit blowing out over the lake. Lake Erie is beg enough that it reaches the horizon, although from where I am looking most of that horizon is taken over by the edges of this bay, and an island, I believe, the name of which escapes me.  There are white-, yellow-, and turquoise-bellied, swallow-shaped birds darting about the shoreline, and the tiniest of waves, mere inches, lap idly against the breakwater rocks.

Yesterday, I pulled out of the private campground, and drove five hours to get here. I made three stops along the way: two for gas, and one for groceries. I've started missing my diaries, and so I've taken to making voice recordings, which aren't making it onto this blog, unfortunately. Perhaps this evening, or tomorrow when it's supposed to rain all day, I will transcribe my recordings. Or, maybe, I'll just figure out a way to upload them for you to listen to. Somehow, get them into the text repository underlying this blog. I am not sure which is best.

It was raining as I got into camp, so I just ran and plugged in electrical power. I tried to get the clean water hooked up, too, but the freeze-proof "yard hydrant" spigot defeated me. I still haven't gotten it to work, and I think I might have to ask a neighbor for help.

Before night fell, the rains let up enough for the neighbors to send all their screaming children out into the campground like a whooping rebel detachment. I'm not really complaining. I was just grumpy to be holed up in that thing while the rains came down. I felt guilty, too, for staying inside while in such an exotic location: the banks of Lake Erie.

I often feel this exact sort of guilt while travelling. It's no small expense, but then I find myself holed up in my accommodations, be it RV or hotel. I have to remind myself, "I did not come out all the way to {Chicago,Baltimore,Miami,DC,East Harbor} to sample their WiFi".

But, really, I only came out to East Harbor to make my route to Madison a little easier. I have to remind myself of this, that I am only here because it was *necessary* to stop *somewhere*, to avoid the pangs of guilt over not really making the most of it.

For example, I am currently sitting not fifty yards from the swimming beach. There's one wader. It's sunny, but breezy. This morning I visited the marina, and had a cup of coffee (and, OK, a walleye sandwich) from the marina eatery, *Crabby Joe's*. The waitress told me, yeah, it's too cold for most folks, but next month the place will be crawling with boaters. There was a warehouse, there, sharing a parking lot with *Joe's* out of which a dozen charter fishing operations are run. I am starting to think America is really the land of boaters, and boating fisher-folk.

Like, seriously, everyone seems to be fishing. I might be doing something wrong.

But, far be it from me to learn a new hobby, especially solo.

And solo I am. Very few people talk to me. It's mostly, "good morning" and "sorry about my dog". A few conversations are to be had with birders, who'll reluctantly detail the morning's "catch", but I don't think they're used to being pestered with questions. Maybe they relish what solitude the pandemic's brought. I am, honest-to-god, thinking about dropping in on a Church service, tomorrow, just to be a part of something involving people. Steinbeck did it, in his *Travels With Charlie,* so it's not without precedent. On the other hand, that's a lonesome, crotchety and self-indulgent book I don't need to emulate. Not to mention, I'd hate to be asked if I were a Christian.

Everyone in America who has anything to say about it seems to be. There's about as many churches on the highway as houses, in some parts of the country. Of course, there's plenty more people deeper inland who're populating them, but American land is adorned with stars, stripes, and crosses. It's hard to remember, at these times, that land doesn't vote.

Still, it's just another land-mine waiting in any kind of conversation, isn't it?

People don't ask much, anyhow. There's not much fruitful ground for conversation.

Last time I travelled, I reached out through my social networks, particularly professional technologist networks, and set up meetups with people. Encouraged locals to host meetups on the days I'd be able to attend. That was good, and definitely expanded my loose tie social network for a year or so. I haven't really watered that garden during the pandemic, and I haven't performed that same outreach on this trip, likely because I had such a tight itinerary, and it was partially dictated by the necessities of the second party; my stalwart companion Sam.

I have been so many places where I can only think, "wow, this is great; I can't wait to come back here with friends or family, and in better weather."

That, or "wow, this is horrible. how can people live like this?"

Either way, the answer's got to be "other people."
