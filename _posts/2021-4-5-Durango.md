Yesterday morning we woke up in that Utah Bunkhouse in La Verkin beyond St. George.  We'd bought milks and granola, berries and such for a breakfast but I wasn't remotely hungry. Sam made some tea while I wrote yesterday's post and we were on our way before 10am. Nothing too early, but not dastardly late. I'd like to head out earlier, mornings, but they're hard to pluck. Today I'm writing in the car as we drive out of Durango; an experiment in multitasking? Or filling time that's otherwise spent in mild gawking.

Leaving the bunkhouse, we made our way to Zion National Park, where we'd failed to procure bus passes into the hikable canyon and instead took a liesurely, scenic drive up the side of the orange cliffs, coming out onto the pale, sandier top of the plataeu, if that's the appropriate terminology.

We met an effervescent trio of southeast asian ladies (and their quiet, almost glum male youth who stayed in the back seat) at a scenic pull-out who raved giddily about the many parks and wildernesses they'd reached in their brief reunion (having each flown from a different corner of the states). I think that's a marvelous thing for them to have done. I wish I'd asked how they all met, originally.

We made the most of our visit to Zion by pulling over occasionally, and tramping about the wilderness available to us, most memorably across a slanting stone face towards what I'd later learn to call a "wash" in the mountainside. There we spotted a rock across the wash that looked very much like a toadstool on its own.

It wasn't much of a hike, but it was a nice dip into the alien atmosphere of Zion, a far cry from the paved paradise of Silicon Valley.

We made our way out past Mt. Carmel, stopping only for postcards and then for a quick lunch on a shady lawn out behind a dollar store where we procured the requisite bowls, knives, and spoons for granola and peanut-butter sandwiches. Items of which we'd a plethora in the RV but which we hadn't, in our haste, brought with us on this lighter leg.

We floored it out of Utah, through bits of Arizona, New Mexico, and througgh Four Corners area into Colorado, the landscape changing gradually, from red mesas to sandy buttes in part the color of, as Sam noted, duck eggs.

It's difficult to conceptualize the time each colored layer takes to build up in these wind-worn former plateaus. And it's mind-boggling to think how so many colors return to add another few feet of bright orange after a million year intermission of beige, brown, or deeper red. I found myself wishing I knew the chemical composition of the stone, just as I frequently find myself wondering at the species of flora we pass, which change alongside them.

What's so striking, in that country, is the green-bush-speckled red rock of the mesas. I'd love to find a real high-definition photo of that. I suppose I could've taken one myself and perhaps I have, from the medley snapped out the car window. Perhaps we should more liberally pull over, and take more deliberate landscape photographs? It's not something I'd considered since, I figure, this land's been gone over with a fine-toothed DSLR more than once.

We passed the town of Red Mesa--only a cluster of identically red-roofed houses--which has its own radio station broadcasting obstinate silence. A clear, unperturbed silent band.

More suddenly than either of could really cotton to, we found ourselves winding through a mountain forest of evergreens. The golden plains and beige buttes into which the red messas had gradually melted were unceremoniously behind us, and we were now occasionally asked to halve our speed as we passed through one or two Colorado mountain towns, local troopers awaiting to ticket passersby.

The third such town was Durango, a prosperous and hip little Gen X paradise built right atop the quaint Animas River. We parked downtown, and met my old friend for beers at the outdoor foodtruck foodcourt on 11th Street. It was a supremely charming atmosphere and, from what I we learned there, part and parcel of the generally boisterous social scene of burgeoning Durango.

Had a nice walk, after, through the quiet downtown (all of its four blocks) then visited my friend at his home before packing it in to the Econo Lodge for the night. After seven hours of driving, and a beer, I was unconscious just after 9 o'clock and didn't wake until 7:30am.
