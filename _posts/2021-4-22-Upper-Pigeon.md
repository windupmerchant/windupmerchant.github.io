We took a winding, tumbling ride, yesterday, along the banks of the Pigeon River in an ill-fit craft, plunging between the steep-sided Smokies down a little-known course-- and then we went rafting.

Night before we'd gone to bed fairly early, and rested well. Morning of our river outing, we each made our respective pots of coffee and tea, then headed out to the rafting outfitters' on the banks of the Upper Pigeon River. We were taking off an hour or so early, so we thought maybe we'd get in before the other participants, and cook ourselves a hot breakfast, there.

"How far was your campsite from here?" innocents would later ask.

"Oh, about twenty minutes by car," we'd have to respond, "or a hundred twenty by GPS."

There's a couple of routes over and under the Smokies between Cosby Campground and Hartford, Tennesee. When you look at all the causeways, byways, parkways, and highways available to us, all those lines of varying thickness squiggling about on the map, well, there's an infinite number of ways a vehicle can get from point A to point B.

I suppose we should thank our stars we're not still up there on Highway 32, but perhaps we should've better heeded the morning's augur: what came on the iPod shuffle as we were sipping our hot dawn beverages was "Charlie on the MTA".

To say "we got lost" is not accurate. And when I finally looked up from writing yesterday's entry (I try to get them done without postponing our perigrinations by typing them from the passenger seat on the first leg of the day) I knew, but I cannot tell you how, that *something* was wrong with the route.

Sam confirmed we were not lost. And yet, somehow, according to the GPS, our twenty minutes' drive had suddenly unfolded fractally into a hundred-twenty minutes drive. We were going to miss the tide. How did this happen?

Does time work differently up here, in the mountains? Is it thicker in the ravines where the fog and the wildfire smoke collect like whipped cream on a parfait of salad greens? Does it run faster at the peaks, driven on by constant gusts dropping appreciable temperatures into subjectively negative Kelvins? Does the corn whiskey hold, pickled in suspension, extra hours from bygone frontier days that leak out every time a Gatlinburg tourist opens another jar of the stuff?

Or do the roads simply wiggle like the devil is real, as the roadsigns and songs tell us? Perhaps we'd not found a right road since we'd not, as the signs implored us, gotten "right with god".

Or maybe, as plenty of other signage asserted, "GPS IS WRONG. DO NOT ENTER."

Whatever, however, and whyever, we found ourselves driving, and driving, and not getting anywhere. There are parts of this country where the roads turn around, and cross right over themselves! Google GPS did find us a shortcut out of that open-air warren, but we took a half-second look at that gravel turn-off which seemed to pitch one meter straight down into the ravine at the start and shook our heads. We'd take a paved, winding road over another pitted mud track, no matter how straight. (I've still got bruises on my tailbone from one particular track we took leaving McClellan Creek or thereabouts that keep me honest in this regard.)

It's said you can't measure the circumference of an island, since the measurement depends on the length of your ruler: the smaller the ruler, the more fractal nooks and crannies you'll find yourself measuring. Well, we've taken the measure of a great length of the Smoky Mountains with a 22' ruler that gets 8 miles to the gallon, and I'm here to tell you that they're immeasurably large.

We came to the conclusion we'd not make the I-40, that way--right about when we came to the sign which read "PAVEMENT ENDS".

If you saw the road we were on, you wouldn't believe that Sam made a perfect three-point turn--no more, no less--to hightail it out of there.

And then, we drove all that same, tortuous distance one more time!

With intermittent signal--bouncing, no doubt, off the oblique face of time-bending mountains--we managed to put in a call to the outfitters, and to inform them that we were still on our way, and that we'd a slim chance of making their absolute dead last cutoff before the dam-fed river ran too dry to traverse.

"I have faith that you will," our ambassador informed us. Her faith was not misplaced. We squeaked into the lot by the river, and were met with armfuls of equipment--helmet, paddle, lifejacket. Had we rafted before? Yes we had. Were our waivers signed? Yes they were. Ok! On to the bus!

None of the rapids we surged through that afternoon could match for pathos the twists we'd turned out that morning; our dalliance on the river was a leavening reprieve. Sam sat up front with a lovely young woman from northern Wisconsin making her way to Florida and, catching the brunt of the froth, kept me plenty dry the whole way. We passed an hour and a half alternately floating and propelling ourselves through mild rapids--I only once lost control of my paddle, when the craft tipped mightily to my side, pinning my implement against a rock! (Amusingly, after, our companion would describe that precise moment as a sudden discovery that she was paddling air!)

Both our companions were well-traveled outdoorspersons; our guide no less than the local-born heir to the outfitter company itself. We amused one another by swapping stories of adventuresome hikes and climbs, dives and spelunks--both our own, and the retelling of odd outdoorsy YouTube videos we'd seen about places we'd probably never go. We never saw a bear. It was exceedingly pleasant.

Off the river, we purchased some photos of ourselves and shared them with our chance companion. She was, it happened, going through Asheville tomorrow (today?) and maybe she'd catch up with us in town. (Likely, we won't, since we're so keen to catch up with ourselves on the shores of Carolina that we've booked our night's rest leagues East of town.)

We made our way, then, to Clingman's Dome. We should've, in retrospect, stopped right there in the outfitters' lot by the river and cooked ourselves some lunch. We've dragged this whole kitchen a full four thousand miles, at this point. We did not. We carried on, thinking we'd do so at the base of the famous highest point in the Smokies. I was too hungry. Sam started reading off to me the famed foods of the Appalachians--apple stack-cakes, cornbread & beans, a whole litany of delectables. I pulled off at the next BBQ joint we laid eyes on, and I climbed into the passenger seat to gnaw depserately on a traif bone. Paddlin's hard work, I 'spose.

We made it up to Clingman's Dome, and even up the steepest paved trail I've ever hiked or, as Sam refers to the act of making it down a paved trail, "waddled." The views from atop the spiral observation tower are stunning. I set myself a timer and remained stunned, nearly uninterrupted, for twenty solid minutes.

All sorts of thoughts come into one's head when one's gaze is settled at its maximum possible distance at uncountable crests. I'm not ashamed to say the view, in that time, brought tears to my eyes. Or, it might have been the wind, which frosts the trees only half-white with the fast moistness of a subzero fog.

When we came down, my ears stung like I'd been sunburnt and I was moved to apply a little aloe to them. We made tea, and waited in the dinette--with a nice, framed view of the back of the composting toilets--for sunset to come.

As the sun approached the western ridges, a whole flock of amatuer photographers on field trip came out and took up all the space on the walk. Still, they were pleasant company and, besides, I was unable to look directly at the sunset because of its brightness and the directness of the wind. If you'd like to have a look at the sunset I saw, perhaps it's still available at [BearWoodsPhotography.com](http://BearWoodsPhotography.com)!

We drove back in the dark, and I'll be damned if I didn't blow right past the campsite turnoff and right back onto Highway 32. Legend has it, we're still there to this day.
