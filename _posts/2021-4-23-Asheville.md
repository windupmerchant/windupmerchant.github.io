title: Asheville, North Carolina
---

Woke up in Cosby Campground for the last time. No cables to coil in, no hoses to unhook. We tossed our kitchen trash into the bear-proof steel bins, swung by the dump station, told Google GPS to fuck off, we would *not* be going down Highway 32, and plotted a course through the scenic Parkway to Asheville, North Carolina.

The mountains were hazy with smoke, and smelled like a campfire. We pulled into Webb's Gas & Market, the oldest, most rundown gas station I've ever seen--it had mechanical spinning-drum volume counters--and a fellow came out to help us pump our gas. He said it was wildfires causing the smoke. We made small talk. Was he Webb? No. Where's Webb? He's dead.

On our way out of the mountains, we saw a few plumes of smoke rising up from the trees. I guess we lucked out for clean air, ourselves.

We hit Asheville later that morning. I can't say if we'd had breakfast in the RV, that morning. Maybe just coffee and tea. Some mornings we'll eat granola--Sam's with milk, mine with yogurt, blackberries, pepitas, sunflower seeds, and almond slivers--and other mornings, if we've got electrical power for the microwave, Sam'll make what he calls "hot breakfast", or what I would call "oatmeal", which he makes with milk and sugar, and which I make with boiling water, blackberries, pepitas, sunflower seeds, almond slivers and some stale old dried goji berries that're awfully sticky, and clump together.

We hadn't had any of that, the morning we got into Asheville. What was on our mind was Apple Pie, for some reason. We hadn't, still haven't, found any. What we found was Tastee Diner, where I finally broke down and placed an order for Fried Chicken & Waffles, "Tastee-style," which involved a sweet pickled chile marmelade that was quite novel to me. My mouth waters at the memory of it.

We ate inside, because it was cold, and there were no other customers when we arrived. We finished our meals in due course and did not linger. Did not even go for a second cup of coffee.

From the driver's seat, across the street from the diner, I called the Black Mountain College Museum, and pleaded for an opportunity to visit. Just our luck, they had availability right then, and we were only seven minutes' drive from their spot down a historic, brick-paved street in Asheville. We found parking for all our twenty two feet with uncanny ease, masked up and marched into an almost empty gallery of works by former educators of the BMC, their students, and at least one artist whose piece simply incorporated a typeface designed by BMC faculty, possibly Buckminster Fuller himself.

We perused the exhibits and such for an hour or so, then exited through the gift shop. I had in mind to visit the old BMC campus itself, but that's been sold off to private ownership, and so the buildings they constructed--in, one might speculate, accordance with their utopian principles--weren't available for public exploration.

We visited a distillery, instead. "American Whiskey," the distiller and our tour guide would clarify, as opposed to scotch. "We have nothing to do with scotch."

It was a short tour, mostly just a run-down of the chemical/mechanical processes which turn rye or other grains into liquor. Fascinating, to be sure, and a beautiful piece of engineering. The still, imported from Germany, was an impressive contraption into which seven steel 3,300 liter barrels would pour their "1-dimensional," hopless beer to be distilled once, twice, three times. Just enough to remove what didn't taste great. The distillation would be periodically tasted, cut into jugs, collected into steel vats, then matured--not aged--into whiskey. I say matured, rather than aged, because these folks believe they've found a shortcut to leaving their whiskey in an oak barrell for fifteen years: tossing an oak spiral (maximum surface area) into the maturing vat.

They've won some awards, so, who am I to judge? Still, it seems they've faced some steep criticism for this process, as I got a distinct sense of defensiveness from the proprietor. Defiant whiskey's got a chip on its shoulder. Can you taste it?

Altogether, an impressive shop that was, unfortunately, offline when we visited.

We left with a couple bottles of the stuff, and headed to what was marked on our maps as a ghost town, and turned out to be a well-preserved Company Town. Built in 1905 to house workers at the river-side cotton spinning mill, it was sold to a private individual when the mill shut down in 1965. They did almost nothing with it, and it was bought by a collective when it went on the market last decade. The collective is one part for-profit, restoring the houses into vacation rentals, and one part non-profit, giving tours and building a museum.

I was delighted to discover it was a Company Town, which I'd only read about. Complete with a Company Store that took Company Scrip! Imagine that: living in a house you'll never own, paid in money that's good for nothing anything but giving it back to the boss in exchange for subsistence staples. A real hustle. We even got to see some of the scrip, which was a thril. Though once made of paper, they were eventually minted (in Ohio) into real dollar-sized coins.

I can imagine there were plenty of ways in which it was comfortable to live in a company town like that, but too few Americans know about the exploitative machinations of mill and factory owners who put together schemes like these, and still do, today, where they can get away with it (not too much in America, as far as I know).

We had a private tour through the old mill village, given to us by an enthusiastic local Millennial with a history degree who was plenty knowledgeable and answered all our questions. Unfortunately, it wasn't safe to visit inside any but one of the buildings, and that one had been remodeled by the crew of the Hunger Games to shoot District 12.

So if anyone asks you what a dystopian hellscape looks like, tell 'em a Company Town makes for a good blueprint.

I don't know how to fit this into the post above, but it's worth mentioning that this had been an all-White town. Slave plantations weren't as profitable in North Carolina as nearer the coast, and so places like these didn't have large Black populations to contend with after the Civil War. They remained White.

From Henry River Mill Village we made it, with daylight to spare, to our HipCamp site on a farm, next to someone's barn. We plugged into their electrical outlets and garden hose (we've got a water filter on our end), had the dregs of a bottle of California red, and set to making a wholesome dinner of quinoa, kale, and readymade curry.
