"Oh I've had the COVID. Been vaccinated, all that. I'm not saying it ain't bad. I know it's bad but, you know, those masks aren't doing us any favors, neither. They trap the carbon *dee-oxide,* and that harms your immune system, too."

We're standing in his jerky shop. A pound-and-a-half of product on the counter. He hasn't looked at it, hasn't touched it since we put it down there after browsing his wares. Maybe he's hoping we'll buy more. Maybe he's hoping we'll go for the more exotic flesh--ostridge, alligator, kangaroo, snake--that has a better markup than the old-fashioned beef jerkies we've picked out.

He's been going on about how miserable California is, how ugly San Francisco is, how all he does for exercise is "chase a coon dog", and how this whole pandemic's been blown way out of proportion. How the mandates, and the shutting down of businesses (like his), that was all unnecessary. How we never wore masks for the flu, so why now? How common sense is all the sense we need: washing hands, covering our mouths when we cough. You know, normal hygiene stuff.

"Just don't do anything ignorant," he finishes, ringing us up.

"Easier said than done," I reply, not making eye contact, "in my experience".

After all, we know half of men don't even wash our hands when we leave the restroom. There's nothing "common" about "sense," it's got to be inculcated into us, with urgency, by educational campaigns. There's nothing "intuitive" about viral pathogens. If we're left to folk devices, on this front, we're left with superstition.

I was just about ready to walk out of there without the product. When he started talking about carbon *dee-oxide* gathering in the mask, and disrupting my immune system, I was done. We've heard these lines before. They're baseless rumors spread by right-wing talk radio, and right-wing social media. They're part-and-parcel of the conspiracy theories that engender mass murder, dehumanizing those of us too "ignorant" to join their campaign.

There's no need for this kind of garbage. I've seen America, and we're doing fine. The wheels of industry turn. The harvest is coming out of the ground. We're not facing another dustbowl. We're chock-full of experts in every field. If there's a problem, it's not that we're being corralled by public health officials, it's that in every region we pass there are rich and poor.

We see vine-covered, rusted out trailers with families living in them, just on the edge of a two-hundred acre estate complete with white-columned porch and carport. We're stopping at broken down, "pay inside" gas station delis manned by miserable geezers just down the road from a Hardrock Cafe charging five times as much for a burger and fries. And the guys in those trailers and gas station delis, they're listening to the radio stations on which the Hard Rocks advertise, who'd never speak ill of their corporate sponsors, but will go on *all day* about the Jews, the Asians, and the public health people--although they call the latter group "politicians", even when they're just civil servants, like the CCC who built all the parks around here where folks can proudly wear the Confederate flag t-shirts they bought from the gas station deli.

It drives me nuts these people will so gladly tear into any odd, remote stranger but let their neighbors waste away.

Gatlinburg is a fake village, made artificially quaint, with winding fake cobblestone streets, and fake old-fashioned windows, and fake shingles on the roofs, no doubt extending only as far as the eye-line from the street, and the rest done like any Walmart's, which is practical. They've got a shop that just sells socks. They've got another that just sells candy.

Sam and I, arriving from our campsite after an unrushed morning, parked behind a rustily defunct chairlift up the side of a hill on the edge of the Gatlinburg business district. We hadn't seen the town, yet. We'd heard it was quaint. We'd heard Pigeon Forge, the next town north, was commerciale and kitschy in comparison. So when we got into town, and the first thing we saw was a little corn whiskey distillery, we didn't then know that there were three such distillieries on this road. I was looking for corn whiskey--since I'd read a bit about the tradition over at the Knoxville "Museum of Appalachia"--but had whisked past every pedestrian liquor store we'd seen from the road. Only now, actual pedestrians, did I have what I thought was my chance for the simple transaction of cash for corn whiskey.

It turned out to be a whole thing. We did a tasting of several whiskey-based liquers and such before getting upsold into buying several varieties of the stuff in jars. I don't regret it.

Then we left our purchases behind the bar, with my name in sharpie on the crate, and strolled down Gatlinburg main street with the receipt.

We almost immediately passed three different Ripleys' amusement institutions. A host of "luxury" accommodations. An endless array of kitchiness. We were looking for a loaf of bread to take camping, but the only "bakeries" in Gatlinburg exclusively sold one (1) of cookies, cakes, doughnuts, or "flapjacks".

This is not a real town. One can only imagine what bedevilment happens in Pigeon Forge. Tell you what, on reflection, I bet it's a mite more honest, and cheaper. No Ripleys' or Hard Rock Cafes to boost their traffic. Only home-spun quackery. It remains a mystery.

After we perused the shops, and bought ourselves some iced coffee drinks from a nice Italian barista, we made our way back to the motorhome and drove through town to the Smoky Mountains National Park HQ for maps and such. There, we also chanced upon a half-mile stroll to a picturesque waterfall. Then, we lit out for our campsite, where we spent a relaxing afternoon in the woods: Sam, in his hammock, me running about with a pamphlet identifying trees (Red Maples) and flowers (Common Violets, Woods Stonecrop, Celandin, and something that had too many petals to be a Bluet, and leaves too thin to be a Wild Geranium).

Dinner was a tomato sauce made from scratch with onions, broccoli, and kidney beans over our chosen starches: pasta for Sam, quinoa for me. After dinner I transformed the dinette into my bed, and read more pages of "A History of the American People."
