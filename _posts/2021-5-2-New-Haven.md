title: New Haven, Connecticut

The "East Rock" Neighborhood of New Haven, Connecticut is a lovely place, even if they're unafraid to ask a guy who's parked his RV in front of their house if he's "moving in".

I did spend the night in the rig, parked outside some stranger's house. But only because my hosts, here, were coming home late, themselves, and I didn't feel right falling asleep in their house before they got in--which, in retrospect, is silly.

Nevertheless, I woke up to the sounds of pedestrians making their way from the local coffee shop to the East Rock Park. It's a legendary park, with a hikeable promontory and the ruins of Eli Whitney's mill. Yes, that Eli Whitney who patented the *cotton gin* in 1793, ensuring the economic sustanability of the slavery-based cotton industry. All that's left are the foundations of a forge, and a rebuilt coal shack. That, set in a beautiful swampy hillside replete with native *Flowering Dogwoods (Cornus florida)*, and the cute-but-invasive *Chocolate Vine (Akebia quinata)* and *Garlic Mustard (Alliaria petiolata)*. It's nice to hike with cell reception, so I can look these things up as we encounter them.

When we visited the park in the aftternoon, I also saw a bird which I'd hoped was a grackle, and asked a passing birder if he'd seen any.

"Right there!" he responded, pointing vaguely in the direction it'd flown. So, that was pretty validating. A grackle is just a little black bird with some subtle blue iridescence. They're fairly common, but I find them handsome.

In the morning, we'd had a reunion of sorts in the mowed-lawn area at the front of the park. Like the other visitors, we'd run down to the coffee shop, first, to pick up snacks and beverages. Two other old friends had come down from their nearby transplant home to visit on this occasion, and so our five-person party of three households was a special, rare treat. We had a lot of catching up to do, and a lot of stories and plans to share. The wind, which had been considerable, calmed down for a few hours, and we enjoyed the cool spring day.

In the evening, my hosts prepared a squash soup to which I contributed an onion from my larder. We ate, joked, and talked politics. While they discussed, at length, some novel particulars of domesticity, I washed up and, after dinner, we played a few rounds of a strategy computer game you might have heard of: Star Craft.
