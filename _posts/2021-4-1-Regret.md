What's it harder to mourn? The money, or the trip? The life I've built up for myself in my mind? What's it going to cost to remove it from my mind? From my stomach? Am I going to go back to the way things were? Back to stagnation, and dizzying disorientation?

What would I do differently, if I went home from here? Buy a car, maybe. Something reliable. Something zippy. Would I stay in the bay?  This is a whole life I'll have to imagine from nothing.

Well, not from nothing. I'll have my plans. I've got them in my head, and in my belongings, and in my heart. I mean, any attempt is worth pursuing. Or, rather, any attempt builds within oneself the experience to make a future attempt.  Not at driving across country in an RV, but at designing a life. At compartmentalizing one. Packing for one. For the essentials.

If we rebuild this transmission, for a chunk of change (split two ways, mind you)...

For how long does one mourn that kind of money? Does one mourn money? Or experiences? Failures? You can't pay enough for these. Isn't that what it is? To go broke, as wildly and disastrously as possible?
