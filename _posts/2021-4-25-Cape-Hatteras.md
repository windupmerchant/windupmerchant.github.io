Woke to the chirps and squawks of an uncountable number of shore birds, this morning, and fell asleep to the same, that night. Terns, gulls, willets, and many more we couldn't find in our *Birds Of Tennessee* pamphlet since we were, most assuredly, camped out on the Eastern-most edge of the continent, North Carolina's Outer Banks.

We had a leisurely morning, a leisurely afternoon, a bit of a sprint around dinner, but a leisurely evening, thenceforth.

The entire day was planned for the enjoyment of this remote coastline, and that's how it went. After tea and light breakfast, we migrated the motorhome some hundred yards to the beach-access "ramp", parked ourselves with a view of the sea, donned sandals and bathing trunks, and made our way to the waves.

The water is, as I'd been told, warmer than that of the Pacific at this latitude. It was not, however, warm! Still, the sun was mostly shining, and after our metabolisms caught up with the situation, I was exceedingly comfortable bobbing about in the surf, diving through waves, and even trying to catch a few.

This was not the swimming beach, but a second drive-up-and-fish beach. Still, the anglers left us our space. None of them warned us that there was a swimming beach just over the dunes to our North. We must've looked a bit moronic, though, cavorting about in sandals not forty yards from their diesel trucks.

We polished off a few of the cheap beers from our Grand Canyon site host, and alternated between reading and dozing. I don't like to drink and read, since it constrains retention, so I re-read a passage of the book that we'd already listened to in audio format while driving back from Clingman's Dome, the highest point in the Great Smokies. Perhaps some of it will have sunk in, although I can't at the moment recall its subject. Revolutionary war stuff, perhaps.

That was it! Several hours passed this way, interrupted only by the re-application of sunscreen and the occasional adjustment of one's hat to counter the little sandy gusts.

Sooner or later, we grew hungry, and also curious to see the famous Cape Hatteras Lighthouse--tallest in America. Lunch was tuna salad, eaten with the Passover Matzah crackers I've still hardly put a dent in. After showering off the saltwater, and changing into dry clothes, we re-parked for a second time, now in the lot outside the lighthouse.

The tower itself was closed to let lacquer dry, but there was a little museum dedicated to the bravery of local rescuers who managed to save the many sailors who ran aground--despite the guiding beacon, I suppose! There were also exhibits on the keepers' families who say it was for from a lonely venture; local townsfolk were always coming out, they said, to visit. Visiting the lighthouse, especially on a Sunday afternoon, was quite the social scene! So, let not the ostensible solitude quash your dreams of lighthouse-keeping, you extroverts.

The afternoon we spent attending, virtually, a party to mark the occasion of my nephew's 1st birthday! It was nice to see my family's smiling faces, and hear their voices. The mobile network reception on Cape Hatteras belies its remoteness, some thirty miles from the mainland. Using the watercolors provided (received via post, along with other party favors, at our intermediate address back in Memphis), I painted a Goldfinch, the brightest-colored bird I'd seen on our travels. I think they're native even to California. I did not trust myself to accurately portray the warped dimensions of an Tern.

After the party we visited a local grocer to pick up vegetables, and some local coffee and beer as souvenir. We'd hoped to have some local-caught fish, for dinner, but it wasn't sold at this grocer! It's a known fact, I suppose, that fish is so readily available at so many outlets up and down the Point that the grocer won't bother stocking it. We ran down the block as closing time approached to a restaurant and market and snuck in just as the fishmonger was making his last sale.

He told us he was closed. We promised we only wanted to make a simple purchase. Just one piece of fish. Nothing fancy. That flounder looked ideal. He gruffly accepted our money, cursing at the register and curtly shooing away all subsequent customers. We left with our fish. He locked the door.

We fried that flounder with cajun seasonings--one of the party favors my sister Lynne had sent to help us celebrate nephew's birthday--white wine, butter, and lemon. We had sauteed cabbage on the side, and drank some of the rest of the wine. After dinner, we finished watching Sean Connery and Michael Caine lose their fortunes down a ravine (and Connery, his head!), and turned in.
