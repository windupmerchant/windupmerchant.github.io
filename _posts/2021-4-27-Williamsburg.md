title: Williamsburg, Virginia
---

Williamsburg is an estuary where commercial forces mix with history geek forces, producing a spiraling pocket of commodified geekery. Theirs is a unique blend of kitsch, and what do we call unique kitsch?

As a child, I enjoyed coming here and getting "conscripted" into the revolutionary army--made to carry a toy gun and march in formation with other visitors' children. I enjoyed the fife and drum music. I have always envied the framers their new-fangled coffee shops where they hyper-actively plotted utopias.

As an adult, I now know that the framers' free time was built of enslaved servitude. There were enslaved Africans all over Williamsburg. Some forty percent of the inhabitants were enslaved, in 1776 and the enslaved population of the colonies doubled during the Revolutionary War.

It should be unconsciounable to envy the framer's their wealth and opportunity, but nevertheless I find the story of national sovereignty compelling.

Visiting Williamsburg with the knowledge I've gained since adolescence is no less engaging! I am heartily impressed by the depth of interpreters' knowledge on all things historical. It seemed that no question could stump the folks posted at the magazine--in-between demonstrative musket firings four times an hour--or the carpenters' sawhouse where the components of the replica homes are built and repaired, painstakingly, with historically accurate tools. I was happy to pester them, endlessly. I wish I had asked more about economics of the merchants' interpreters, more about fashion at the clothiers'. The weaver was quite enthusiastic, I remember, about how important it was, in town, to alter clothes to keep up with fashion.  Another thing he kept saying was "sell tobacco; go shopping," a concise maxim for a plantation colony for whom no other industry was profitable in the face of global trade.

There was no tobacco to try.

We did eat pucks of ginger cake, and try on hats, and lob the occasional joke six feet over to the odd socially-distant felow visitor.

At a certain point, though, it starts feeling a bit unproductive to enjoy myself like this. Am I really the end repository for this knowledge? I come here, I learn, and where do I go with that information? Am I just piping data into `/dev/null`? To enjoy oneself is a fine thing, but it's hardly satisfying. Is the world larger for my having had a piece ginger cake? For knowing an iota more about General McClellan? An iota about the graduated iron hooks which allowed colonial cooks to control the heat on a hanging pot? An iota about the bellows which heated the raw iron to form those hooks? An iota about the Virginia's long history of iron and coal mining?

Is the world larger for what I know?

I don't mean to dismiss introductory, passing knowledge as worthless. On the contrary, I consider every fact a gem of equal carat, as they all must integrate meaningfully inside one's novel head.

Only, I just wonder if this kind of tourism is purely self-indulgent, and not necessarily in a way that makes my own inner world more spacious. Something has felt inherently worthwhile about exposing myself to the forest, to the sea, or even to the novelty of a strange town built on strange industry. These things have an organic, unlearnt knowledge in them. They're infinitely mysterious and, visiting them, we always bring fire down from the mountain. There's much to be gained, I've felt--I've insisted, in internal monologue--by visiting strange places.

But now I am wondering: where does it all go? This kaleidoscope of encounters I've collected over the past month. What will it fertilize? What *must* it, to have been worthwhile? Or was it an accomplishment in itself, a necessary unfolding of eventualities; an unavoidable article in the long, deterministic parade of possibilities?

Excuse me, it's time to empty the waste tanks.
