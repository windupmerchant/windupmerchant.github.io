Woke up in New Haven, again. In a real bed, once again. Wrote in the diary, a bit, then hiked up to the promontory edge of "East Rock" which overlooks the city. We could even look across to the sound, and across that water to New York's Long Island.

Returning from our hike, I grabbed a loaf of bread and some vegetables at the bodega which we turned into scrumptious egg-salad sandwiches.

I spent a good hour or so turning a garden bed, in the afternoon. I probably should have brought more drinking water out to the garden. I could probably do it again, now, in half the time. Not sure I really want to. While I was turning it, all I could think was "haven't we invented technology that obviates this activity?"

We mowed the weeds down, turned the bed, planted fava beans five inches apart, and soaked them in. I will not see those fava beans sprout, but someone will. The interns for the Yale Landscape Lab will. Sometimes, I would pause for breath in-between plunging the shovel to break up the weedy root-clumps, and think to myself, "why am I laboring to prepare someone else's harvest?"

That old saying, "maturity is planting trees you won't live to eat from" kept me going, but I did eat from that garden. This morning, we scrambled eggs into spinach harvested from a different row of the garden.

On our way back from the garden, I slipped an envelope into the corner mailbox--$32 dollars for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority of Tampa Florida.

I had a shower when we returned. Genna remarked that I'd been brief. I suppose I've gotten much more efficient at bathing, since carrying around my shower water for a month.

We had a delicious dinner of New Haven pizza--margherita, and *clam*--and wine, while watching Google's AlphaStar AI beat a world-champion human StarCraft player on YouTube.

We played a few rounds of StarCraft ourselves with a friend. We played against three strangers and were handily defeated. I really didn't pull my own weight. Then we had to get offline to preserve bandwidth for Genna's Zoom presentation. I went to sleep at eight o'clock, and woke up twelve hours later.
