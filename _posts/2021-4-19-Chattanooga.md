We're on the road, again. This is the second of today's three legs: from Chattanooga to Knoxville, home of the *Museum of Appalachia*. This morning we drove the first leg from Bagenstoss Farms to Chattanooga, in time to catch the horizontal incline train up to the top of Lookout Mountain. This evening, once the museum's closed, we'll finish our drive through Pigeon Forge to Gatlinburg, "gateway to the Smokies."

Yesterday we woke up in Memphis, and shot due East outta there, not even stopping in Nashville. I was fine with that; I'd had enough of city life, with its crowds, its traffic, and its loud noises. See, I'm turning into a coutry boy, yet.

The ride out of Memphis was easy. We stopped for coffee and grits at a local cafe--Sam ordered waffles, but they were out and served him Eggos instead. I am sure my grits came from a box, too. That's how they're best, isn't it? And cheapest, thanks to economies of scale.

We didn't do any sight-seeing east of Memphis, only stopping at a Piggly Wiggly to provision our larder with the victuals we'll need to survive four days' camping in the Appalachians with no amenities but those we bring in. That was novel enough. We then wound our way through greener, and greener forests until we started seeing signs for Bagenstoss Farms--and, not coincidentally, Bagenstoss Bail Bonds. I suppose they're a family with some land and cash for usury.

I wonder how they're spoken of in any of the fifteen different churches we saw leaving that place, this morning, for Chattanooga.

The latter is a big ol' town. A regular city into which we didn't dare venture, only looking out over it and the Moccasin Bend of the Tennessee River from the top of Lookout Mountain to which the short train took us up that 72.7% grade--straight up the side of the mountain.

At the top was a National Park dedicated to the Civil War "Battle of Chattanooga" and "Battle Above the Clouds," which was fought for the mountain itself, a landmass of strategic, long-distance signalling importance.

We walked around the top of the mountain for a bit, looked up a few of the houses on Zillow (1.8M for a 4b4b mountain-side manor of 4.8k sqft with an unbeatable view of the river and the city beside it) before making our way back to the train, back down the mountain, and into Chattanooga.

On our way out of Chatt we stopped by a boardgame store and--while I chatted with the clerk, looking unsuccesfully for a Civil War simulation game--Sam called ahead to book excursions like rafting in the Appalachians, or a scenic flight over Kitty Hawke, North Carolina. We'd hoped to sail in the mouth of the Roanoke River, but it ain't the season for it. The whole region's just not that busy until May.

We ate tuna sandwiches in the parking lot of the game store. Although Sam thought the mayonaise might've turned, he didn't notice I'd already eaten it. I guess we'll find out, won't we! Another piece of news: the rafting outfitters have moved all their tours to the 22nd, expecting not to run any on the 21st due to *snow*! So, that'll be the day that Sam and I hike the Appalachian. Hope it doesn't snow too bad, because I don't want to pack longjohns on my hike. We'd better make sure to print maps and check our compass at regular intervals on the way out, 'lest the route become obscured by snow. I don't expect it, personally, and I couldn't find any mention in any forecast of snow, but I'll trust the locals to have a few things figured out that my jumble of apps don't.
