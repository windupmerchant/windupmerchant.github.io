Coming into Needles last night was exciting! We'd been driving through the darkness of the desert, seeing only the accasional Joshua Tree lit up by a passing semi's oblique headlighting, when gradually we became aware of a glimmering line across the horizon, and then much closer: a city on banks of the Colorado River, opposite us in Arizona.

It had been a long day of driving. I know I said we'd never drive so much as we had on our way back from Utah, but when we got through Las Vegas (with only a brief Starbucks stop for tea and sous-vide eggs) and down into Bakersfield, and when the repaired rig roared back into life under us, we wanted desperately to make back some of the time we'd lost, and so plunged into the desert once again.

The morning had started easily at Econo Lodge Hurricane; we made a pot of coffee by the bathroom sink, packed our bags and hit the road. Utah was just as we remembered it from earlier: gargantuan, bizarre landscapes eventually flattening out. We knew we were in Nevada when the mountains began to look "normal" again--that is, triangular and brown.

All the way we listened to "The Worst Hardest Time," and made short work of the distance, coming in to Performance Truck & Diesel of Bakersfield before four o'clock. Cash was exchanged. Keys were returned. Sam asked for, and received, one of their trademark hats.

Then we were off to rid ourselves of the rental car. We convoyed down to Enterprise, and parked both vehicles in the lot. It took a few minutes for my brain to readjust to the lumbering, bouncing house-on-wheels, so different from the Dodge Journey mini-SUV which was no Porsche itself.

Leaving Enterprise, we pulled through "The Filling Station" drive-through coffee shop, and greeted the attendant, Andy, from whom we'd bought iced coffees the week prior, while waiting for Enterprise to bring our car around. Then, he'd told us stories of his own past road trips and, today, he was happy to hear about ours, and share (prompted, I think, by recognition of Sam's British accent) the tale of his own ancestor's arrival from England to Ventura County, some four generations back.

We'd intended to stop for gas, and to empty our waste tanks, and to fill up on propane for our stove and hot water taps, but when the ground started peeling away behind us, it just felt too good to stop in town, and so we got on the highway for a bit to put some mileage on. After a while, we felt we'd built up enough inertia to stop; we pulled over at a Flying J station, famously outfitted for truckers and RVers with gas, propane, and cisterns for waste fluids. We lucked out; the last employee rated for filling propane (we can't do it ourselves) was only just leaving for the day. We managed to snag her before she went home, but she wasn't sore about it.

Having now rolled through them twice, I am compelled to admit that the steep, green hills east of Bakersfield are some of the most beautiful, simple country on this continent. Just wild grass, ideal for grazing. I like to imagine they're grazing sheep attended, perhaps, by (spiritual) descendents of the early shepherds, an example of whose cabin we'd seen at the Kern County Museum with bed, stove, and little else.

A comfortable life. One devoid of both tumult and ambition.

In our own, rolling cabin, just past these idyllic hills, we'd come to a full stop, as there was an accident on the highway ahead. We never saw it, as it had been cleared before we finally made it to the front of the clot. In that time, we called ahead to the RV Resort in Needles and apologized prematurely for our impending late arrival. And then we just kept the audiobook rolling as Southern California melted away into the night.
