I arrived in Madison on the fourteenth of May, and I'll leave on the Fourteenth of June. That's two weeks past, and two weeks hence. And, in the meantime, I will try and scrape together something of a routine for myself.

This morning, there were a few things between myself and this journal entry. One was the satchel in which I keep my little typing-laptop (as opposed to my great, honking code-processing laptop). Another was the clutter on the desk. A third the stickiness of my skin, the washing of which was blocked by the fullness of my wastewater tanks. A fourth was my penchant for coffee, triggered by the sight of the carafe as I returned from showering in the house to which I am attached by white hose, orange extension cord, and kitchen door.

So while I had intended (not consciously, not this morning) to sit down straight away and journal, I had first to don some vague semblance of an outfit, clamber out of the vehicle, enter the permanent abode of my sister and brother-in-law, bathe, re-dress, caffeinate, read the paper (NYT's last "At Home" section), visit with family, raturn to the rig, clear a space, turn on the machine, find the proper file-folder, and fiddle with some metadata.

Or, perhaps, I *had* to do none of those things, and only had them to do. That is, they were available.

The purpose of this journal is manifold. On the one hand, it's to clear my head. Or, rather, unclear it. To draw into focus the memories of previous days, and glue them together into my permanent memory. On the other it's to leave behind anchors to those memories, revisitable at a later date. On another, to share these experiences with distant friends and family who--by time, distance, and economic obligation--are deprived the opportunity to know me so well as they might. To know me as I change. As I am, now. And, for me, as well, on a fourth hand, to know myself.

I am torn between these purposes, because who wants to read the mental house-keeping of an itinerant layabout? And, who wants to a join a life that's sporadically broadcast, and through another's biased eyes? So while I feel some obligation to retain the privacy of the friends, family, and strangers I visit with on the road, I also feel an obligation (to myself, as much as to the hypothetical reader) to narrate those most vital moments of social interaction.

I suppose I have spent a lot of time talking about landscapes, flora, and fauna. Or, I've tried to. And that's OK, too.

But now I am transitioning away from a pure, whirlwind adventure into something more pedestrian. Something more domestic, albeit only slightly. The people I am seeing, and staying with now are working. I am no longer colliding with the wind-swept, road-dusted adventurers on the side of the highway, at the top of the mountains. I am entering back into the world.

It's true that I have always been in the world, let's face it. Every museum docent, every gas station attendant, every grocery clerk has been there on their nine-to-five, holding the fort and enabling me, my companion Sam and our cohort to ricochet about the boundaries of civil society in maximal comfort and safety. It's only a delusion that we tourists entertain that we've departed the mundane, and endured the sacred.

For me, it's certainly a bit confusing because I wasn't taking time off from work. I was taking time off from sitting on my hands. And, now, I am almost sorta back to sitting on my hands. When I am not literally moving through the world, when I am not staying at campsites (no matter how close they are to the nearest Walmart, the nearest downtown financial district!) and lunching at parks, what am I? Who am I? Living in a van, as they say, down by the river?

I've got a few more months to figure that out. Or, to never answer the question. I suppose I can just keep doing whatever, writing it down, and *you* can let me know, when I'm next in town, who you think I am. What you think I am doing.

For me, though, I think I'd like to figure out how to get a sort of routine going. Some sort of habits. I'd like to reorient my ambitions from the map to the calendar. From the calendar to the day-planner. From the rich, external world to the rich, internal life of the mind?

No, that actually sounds terrible. "I am trying," it seems like I am saying, "to spend more time on the computer, while sitting in my car."
