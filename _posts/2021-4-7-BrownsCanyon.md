title: Brown's Canyon
---

After a quick veggie scramble breakfast, we pulled out of Woodland Lodge in Salida and just around the corner into the visitor's center. I grabbed a map, and filled my waterbag as best I could, although the fancy bottle-filler apparatus didn't quite allow for proper angle. While Sam got the lowdown on hikes in Brown's Canyon (ie not to take the loop we'd picked out from the map, which was allegedly ill-marked and would've gotten us lost), I walked a block into downtown to pick up a pair of sunglasses from a runners' equipment shop. They also gave us the skinny on a little-known trail down to a picturesque gorge which, I realized, was the hike we'd taken the day before. A shame we'd not had time to reach the gorge.

We drove up to Brown's Canyon, and parked by a well-kept campsite on the banks of the Arkansas River, then hiked four-and-a-half miles up and down the mountains to, well, another spot on the banks of the Arkansas river where we took a dip in its snowmelt waters. If it weren't for the rocky bottom, we might've stayed in longer, but we were both keen to dry off before the hike back, and so we clambered out, sun-dried and split the jerky and pistachios. I had myself a brief nap in the sun, lulled by the burble of the Arkansas.

The hike back was made more exciting by our difficulty finding markers, as well as the gathering of clouds, and the rise of a chill wind coming, we later figured, down from the *real* mountains on the horizon. That's also when I noticed I'd run out of water, although Sam had extra I'd share if I began to feel parched. Indeed, I was struggling to breathe through my nose, ascending, and my lips were chapping in the dry air.

As we arrived back at the campsite where we'd parked, we passed two millennial women walking a dog, and then the clean, white motorhome from which they'd disembarked. While I squinted at their slide-out window, making out the blue collared shirt of the man sitting in the dinette within, Sam looked away to avoid pangs of envy.

On the drive back, I struggled to write the journal entry I'd neglected that morning--having lollyagged at breakfast, and driven the first leg myself--but I couldn't seem to string words together. I tried writing a quick scratch page, just stream-of-consciousness to "prime the pump," as it were, and it came out pure gibberish.

We stopped at a gas station in South Park (or was it Fairplay?) where I grabbed a bottle of iced, black tea which perked me up considerably, and I was able to flesh out the notes I'd taken in Turret. I think if I hadn't taken those notes, or if I hadn't had that tea, I'd have been unable to journal. I was feeling pretty glum about it.

After a harrowing 45 minutues of trying to order food over sparse network throughput while a sudden snowstorm broke over us, we made it into Denver in time to eat our curries and pad thai before heading to bed in the cozy guest rooms of Sam's old friend's.
