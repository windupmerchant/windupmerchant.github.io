title: Chickasaw, Oklahoma

Perhaps on account of the rain we woke a little late, Wednesday, and got a later start than we'd intended. The plan was to catch a Lyft ride to the visitors center at the northern end of the park, and then hike back down to our site and strike camp. The night before, we'd thrown on the mobile data hotspot, and seen a few cars in our vicinity. Around here, there's not much distance between the town and the park. In fact, when we finally made our way to the top of Chickasaw National Recreation Area, we found it to be aptly named: while the southern end was left to trees, hunting wilds and hiking trails, the northern end was as tidily mowed and as built up as any urban park--and only across the street from the Donut Palace, and the rest of Sulphur, Oklahoma.

So perhaps that proximity had given us the confidence to believe that it was possible for an app-dispatched taxi to hear about us, find us, and drive us ten miles up the road, so we could hike them back.

The morning of, however, we had no cell signal, and were unable to hail a ride. We modified our plan: we'd hike north, instead, and then hail one back.

The hike north was exceedingly pleasant. The land glowed green, and every inch of earth was covered in plant life. This was a wild difference from the deserts we'd been travelling through. From the high plains of Colorado, through the alien buttes of Utah, over the juniper-studded hills of New Mexico, and to the weed-tumbling, dust-bowling "Great American Desert" of North Texas and Western Oklahoma we'd seen a lot of bare earth. In Chickasaw, emerald blades of grass took every opportunity to soften the terrain. Indian Paintbrushes--the first flowers we'd seen!--sprouted doggedly through the pale gold of prairie sod. Those big ol' deciduous trees in a wide palette of greens cloistered the meadows through which our trail ran: "sycamore, oak, hickory, walnut, pecan," Sam read from the National Park Service brochure as we trod up the track.

I took my time photographing each new, compelling species. I have yet to go through and identify them. The weather was overcast, but not cold; we hiked with our rainjackets off, and stowed. We carried plenty of water in our packs, and even a few nuts & berries for later down the trail.

Eventually, the trail let out into the car camping sites, and then the picnicking sites, the latter of which were accompanied by an old, defuct mineral spring-fed drinking-fountain house. The Civilian Conservation Corps built a stone pavilion around the fountains which fairly distribute the much sought-after mineral waters. They also planted some 500,000 trees, and built the roads, trails, and bridges throughout the park.

When we came through it, the hour was one o'clock and we had been hiking for some three hours. Our campsite checkout was at two o'clock, so we knew we couldn't simply turn around and hike back. We needed to catch that ride we'd planned, since a gasoline-powered internal-combustion engine would make short work of that stretch of Highway 177 which parallels the National Recreation Area.

So, back in civilization, we used our data plans to ring up a Lyft. From the loading spinner on the app, we could tell that it would need to do some figuring, and get back to us.

While we waited for the ride service to pull through, we walked into the Visitors Center to use their plumbing, and peruse their merchandise. I struck up a nice conversation, there, with another visitor who asked us if the *dogwoods* were yet blooming. I didn't know what a *dogwood* was, but I pulled out my phone and showed her a few of the flowers I'd shot. She helped me identify the *honeysuckle*, and the *indian paintbrush*. I was shocked, since I'd seen *indian paintbrush* in the deserts of New Mexico, but found their presence in this lush country incongruous.

The San Francisco-based Lyft taxi company failed us, that afternoon. So did the local, Ardmore-based taxi company who, when we called, told us they'd "do some figuring, and get back to us."

After loudly discussing our options in the Visitors Center gift shop, we tromped back outside. I stuck my thumb out at a few vehicles, but they weren't having it. We turned south, and--before committing ourselves to the fastest late return by foot we could manage--even knocked on the rangers' door. No dice.

The hike back was comparatively arduous. It was mostly the same trail, although even with a few shortcuts it felt steeper, longer, rockier. Sam quickly disappeared up it, and I went for many slow miles in utter isolation, kept company by the spring-green leaves and the indian paintbrushes.

I hoped, fervently, that Sam wouldn't pull out of the campsite without first removing, from the top of the stove, the panful of water we'd left there to soak off last night's garlic-ginger-lemon residue.

I got pretty tired, but I never stopped going. I'd squat for a moment, here and there, to rest some of those tissues which were straining to keep me upright. I'd lose track of my aches and pains by pursuing any odd line of thought, even meditating on the metabolic processes of trees which are, miraculously, crystallized out of thin air. I even entertained some software design considerations, as I am wont to in times of frustration. I even tried meditating on the metabolic processes of plants through the framework of software design considerations, which made me a little queasy and that's when I remembered I had some music on my phone, so I pulled up Kris Kristofferson's "Silver-Tongued Devil" and spent a good twenty minutes listening to that on repeat, practicing for my pool-hall next karaoke debut.

Just as the trail ended, and I came upon the last stretch of road before the campgrounds, the familiar protruding brow of our motorhome came rolling around the bend. Sam had struck camp, and came to pick me up!

"One thing to note," he admitted, as I climbed into the cab, "there was a pan of water on the stove which I'd forgotten, and has spilled."
