title: Resolution

Last night was a fearful, and difficult attempt at sleep. I won't lie; that fear and anxiety have only dimmed a bit with morning's light.

We've resolved to pay the bill. Have the transmission rebuilt. We've had advice to the contrary with all the confidence of armchair quarterbacks. In truth, their alternatives only make me feel sunk deeper, since those alternatives--digging up a junk transmission, and rebuilding that, not our own--seem inaccessible.

We want to get going.

We do not want to spend another day and night in Bakersfield researching, visiting, and negotiating with junk yards and mechanics.

We've got a rental car coming, and we're going to visit Colorado while the RV's in the shop! I can't say I am all that enthusiastic about travel, all of a sudden. I am discouraged.

I've been building up this trip, my hopes in it, my faith in this vehicle for nearly half a year, now, and my confidence in it is shaken. If the transmission can implode (and on the first day, no less!) what happens next? Are we going to end up on the side of the road again, a week after we get it back, and this time looking to tow it to junk?

Somewhere with a UHaul rental, so I can load my sorry packs into the back and head home? And "home" I would head, since I've loaded so much aspirational *junk* into this RV. Books I thought I would read, and games I thought I would play. A whole-ass saxophone I thought would musically open doors like it has for me in other foreign parts. Seems silly, now. Seems really silly.

Like I've said before: all that but not a working transmission? Makes me wonder if I haven't got all my priorities all wrong.

Well, I am afraid our little Denver loop that we're about to take is too much. Too fast. That the pace of it will make us resent our plan. Resent one another. That we'll only be "passing through" too many of the great and miraculous landscapes I'm counting on to revive my spirit. That this stretch will turn into some kind of sprint, some kind of slog, some kind of chore.

And one for which we're paying dearly. Or are we not, hardly, paying at all? What else would I spend the money on, the time? I keep reminding myself I was so miserable, wallowing in stagnancy. Directionless, before this trip. It'd be a real shame to turn back to that.

But what felt like "stagnancy" looks like "security" and "calm" from the parking lot of *Performance Truck & Diesel of Bakersfield*. From the side of the highway under the punishing sun.

I really wish we'd managed to build up a little momentum before this happened. Prove out the theory that a road trip like this is worth taking. Why'd the break have to happen in this liminal space, the very first day of the trip? Is it the worst time, all other things being equal?

Well I'll tell you what's nice: that a tow came. That a mechanic saw us. That the part can be fixed. Or would I rather almost be told "no, you can't do this. go home. unfixable for any price."

I suppose that's never said. There's always a price. There's always some way through. That's the trouble. I've got to know what it's worth, to me.

It's so easy for me to say "no, forget it." It's so easy for me to give up.

Is this true?

When I was bicycling south from San Jose, I only made it so far as Santa Maria, but I had several exhausting, terrifying nights. On the road to San Miguel I only wanted to survive. I'd biked through vacant, inhospitable oil hills all day and until dusk. I'd biked down the mind-numbing shoulder of 101, big rigs and all rumbling past me in the dark, plagued by tumbleweeds, and wanted only to get to safety.

And then, the next day, I continued on. Why? Why keep going, after proving out how low, how close to death, the road can take me?

Why did I keep going? I've said, in the years since, "I wish someone had stopped me."

I injured my knees. I risked death. It cost me thousands of dollars, and what did I attain? An appreciation, I suppose, for the security of "stagnancy"?

That's the classic irony of *the Alchemist*: the treasure you seek is beneath your own hearth. Only, you've first got to risk life and limb (or pay an arm and a leg) to learn it.

And I can't learn it just by knowing it. By reading it. There has to come a change in my neuro-pathways. In the neurons lining my digestive system. You know? I've got to feel it in my gut to believe it.

And, who knows? I might find something in the desert, or the mountains, that I don't expect. I only wish I didn't expect more trouble.
