Woke up early enough to have another liesurely cup of coffee with Genna while my laundry ran in her basement two floors down. Her baby's due in thirty five days, and I've got a bottle of wine earmarked to drink when that baby arrives!

Before I left, we took another walk through the East Rock Park, really soaking in the beautiful sights, and smells. It had rained, the night before, and perhaps that had encouraged the tender leaftips to unfurl a bit more.

I stayed even through lunch, contributing a can of chickpeas from my larder to a magnificent salad we finished just before noon, when I carried my luggage down to the vehicle, and said my farewells.

Departure was, then, anticlimactic. I wasn't headed too far out of town--only one municipality over, to Cheshire where the closest CVS had a dose of Pfizer with my name on it--and the curious resident of the house in front of which I'd parked didn't come out to see me off. Well, now they have their favorite parking spot back.

The car started. It drove. I had a half-tank of gas, and that took me to the CVS parking lot, where there were sufficient over-sized spaces for me. It was a quiet lot.

I was ten minutes too early to check in, or so the website told me, so I picked up some sundries from off my shopping list. Then, I handed my card over to the pharmacist, and she told me to wait.

I waited a long time. My GPS tracker tells me I was at that CVS location for 1.5 hours. I didn't mind, so much, to be honest. I had plenty of daylight. When she did see me, the pharmacist apologized. She hadn't known I was waiting, and had been talking at length with her previous patient who, she emphasized, had been really nervous.

After the shot and a little more waiting, they returned my card and I booked it south and west towards Promised Land State Park (Pennsylvania), where I am now. It was a pretty easy drive, although as I got into Pennsylvania, the road got pretty hilly. I was in and out of "slow lanes" pretty frequently, and flashing back to the hills outside of Santa Fe. The engine, however, did not overheat.

I made it to the Promised Lands, found my campsite real easily, and voila. I was out. Or back in. I was among the trees.

I went for a walk. Down by the creek. I saw a dead deer, there. All bones. White skeleton, teeth and holes. The creek ran by it, undaunted. I remembered a sign, back in town, just before I came into the Park, that said "bear crossing," and I wondered if that was a joke. I've just driven into the park. I haven't look at any interpretive displays. I don't know what kind of fauna is out here. I don't know what killed this deer although, I suspect, it wasn't a bear.

A bear would've made more of a mess, I think. This was a whole deer skeleton. All together. Perhaps the sight of a whole skeleton should reassure me that there are *not* bears in these woods. At any rate, I decided that I should sing for the rest of my hike.

This is novel. I haven't sung aloud in a while. My prior companion had been a scout, but not a singing one. He hiked, but didn't know any hiking songs. I don't know any hiking songs, myself. So, I made some up, based on a lyric I'd misheard that afternoon on the radio.

Tromping over the rocks and roots (it was a very awkward trail), singing, looking out for snakes and bears occupied my evening. Even as it started to rain, I kept going, and the rain let off.

When I got back, the rain began in earnest and it hasn't let up in twelve hours. I boiled myself some tortellini (a spare package from the soup recipe we'd made in New Haven, not a staple of my shopping cart) and ate it with a can of tomato soup. It felt kinda like cheating, throwing together two hot, packaged foods. And since I hadn't yet cleaned my refrigerator, I hadn't restocked with fresh produce. I can do that tomorrow, on my way to the private campground, because I have now spent this rainy morning cleaning out the fridge.

It'll be exciting, I think, to restock a fridge. I had better be sure I don't go overboard. It is heartbreaking to toss broccoli, bluberries, kale, and other fantastic foods that we'd had by Williamsburg, where we'd eaten out, and hadn't realized we'd never cook together again. Not in Philly, where the rig was mothballed for two nights. And by then, I hadn't wanted to mess with it in anyone's driveway in New Haven. So. Loss.

The RVing youtubers warned us about this. How hard it is to shop for such a small kitchen. For few people. It's hard to eat enough of the right things, even when you have them handy.

Today, it is raining. I may not venture out. Perhaps this is a day of rest. I don't feel ill from the vaccine, but I might get stiff if I don't leave the RV at least once.

To do so seems such a chore. Raincoat, rainpants, hiking boots, hat. And to go where? The creek I've just walked last night? Maybe to the shore of the lake, just to walk along it.

Why are apes like us averse to rain? We're not made of tissue paper. We're really very waterproof. I should just go outside.
