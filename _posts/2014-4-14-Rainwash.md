We've finally encountered a bit of humidity, here in the Chickasaw National Recreation Area outside of Sulphur, Oklahoma. We could feel it on our skin, when we turned south after Oklahoma City. The wind lessened, a bit, and we stopped gettinhg static shocks every time we moved. Lush, green, deciduous trees flooded the countryside where dry rock, sparse juniper, joshua trees, and tumbleweed had only just been, it seemed. They clustered around the banks of rivers where we'd only seen dry gullies in SouthEast California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. Rivers with real water in them. Low, muddy, but unmistakeably wet!

After McClellan Grasslands, we booked it to Elk City, Oklahoma--a convenient waypoint on our way to Chickasaw where we could get vaccines courtesy of the State of Oklahoma. We arrived early, and so went for lunch at a state-wide barbecue chain. We were the only folks in there with masks on, although the wait staff had theirs sorta slung under their chin and creeping up on their lower lip. I wonder why people do that. They're mandated, I suppose, but peer pressure drives them to render their prophylactic accoutrement inert.

Parking in a fast-food lot, or even the small lot of the county health department clinic, can be quite stimulating in this thing, but it only takes up 1.25 spaces, really.

After getting our shots, we made great time to Chickasaw, and had a couple hours of daylight left in which to stop over and check out the Bison herd, and even sit with a mug of wine down by the lake, watching a late-afternoon angler pull in some sizeable fish. It was nice to be in early enough to fashion a proper dinner: tossed salad, sauteed veggies fried with rice and chopped up bits of leftover barbecue.

After we went to bed, the show really began. At roughly three in the morning, rain started coming down, popping and crackling against the hard surfaces of our rig. Lightning flashed outside, and thunder boomed in ways it just can't in California, putting me in mind of colliding icebergs in the sky, shearing one another apart. Even the lightning seemed to be audibly tearing through the sky. It went on like that for some hours, illustrating precisely why there are no tent campers out here this time of year. At times it was pretty unnerving, but we had the roof pretty thoroughly resealed before we set off on this journey, and that was some comfort.

Then again, there are other considerations that can arrive in those wee small hours of the morning which no material preparation may ameliorate. I found myself woken up by thunder, but kept up by abstractions. Eventually, abstractions brought me back to sleep, as I began to formulate an algorithm for measuring the distance between two opinions for the sake of identifying clusters of like-sentiment within a larger population of poll responses. One *Flaw of Averages*, recall, is how reducing figures through multiplication can obscure meaningful features of a data set.

This morning, our plan is to app-hitch a ride up to the Chickasaw visitors center, then hike back down to our site before washing up, breaking camp, and heading on to Beaver's Bend. I can't decide if I am hoping the rain will, or won't, return while we're hiking. Between all our showers, towels, changes of cloths, and stovetop kettles we're well-equipped to recover from a surprise dousing.

I am debating whether or not to wear grandad's hat. On the one hand, it'll keep the weather off. On the other hand, it's become something of an heirloom which I'm less inclined to expose to that same weather. Hard to tell when an heirloom becomes a relic. I don't doubt its seen some rain, at times, but if it was designed for what's west of here (it was made in Durango) then maybe it's not built to be soaked.

I don't know what its limits are, but I think we'll just have to find out together.

"Ships are safe in port," and all, "but that's not what they're made for." I am going to try and wear out all my equipment on this trip. I've spent good money on it, and I never quite seem to recoup my bucks. Seasons change, or plans fall apart, and I've been left with adventure-ware and no adventure. It's sensible to pursue, to the fullest, the opportunities these items permit me.

Opportunities like a dry head, and un-burnt ears.
