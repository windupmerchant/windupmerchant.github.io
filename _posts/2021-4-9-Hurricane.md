Pulling back into La Verkin felt familiar. Actually, the whole countryside of Utah now feels familiar. At least, the portion of it through which Interstate 70 cuts, with its endless hills and impassable buttes. All the way, really impressive landscapes that we're not quite through yet as we leave the St. George / La Verkin / Hurricane area.

Woke up in Denver, in Max & Brittany's guest bed, at around 5:30am. Couldn't help it. Nervous energy? We'd not really exhausted ourselves at the train musuem, the day before, so perhaps heading to bed at 9:00pm wasn't really needed. It felt needed, but there I was feeling restless in the early morning.

I spent it combing through the 1800-odd books on my "To Read" list on Goodreads.com and, would you believe it, some forty of them were American history books. I guess I have been meaning to learn about this country of ours for some time. Thanks to a browser plugin maintained by some random individual which injects Libby / Overdrive links into every Goodreads webpage, I was able to quickly scan which of those titles were available as audiobooks through any of my four library memberships, and I started downloading a few of them for the road, later.

When I heard voices, I hopped in the shower and came downstairs for a Nespresso Americana with Brittany and Sam as the former was heading out for work. Sam polished off a few postcards, I polished off a banana and pulled the car around. We were out of there by eight o'clock.

We drove six-hundred and twenty-one miles, that day. We'll not drive so much ever again. When we're back in the rig (new nickname, "The Dace", perhaps, for the revived fish or even Moapa, for their location ("Mo" for short?)) we'll be cruising at an easy 55 miles an hour, doing no more than 330 miles a day. It's not a speedy vehicle.

We figured we'd cover as much ground as we could, and book a hotel only when our eyesight started failing us. For me, that was long before sunset, when my eyes became dry and tired, tearing up. Sam drove the last stretch in, to an Econo Lodge in Hurricane, on a route that took us right by the Davis Food Store we'd stopped at going the other way, when we stayed at the bunkhouse across town, in La Verkin.

Those six-hundred and twenty-one miles were some of the prettiest stretch of road I've ever had the pleasure to cruise. Especially the bit through the canyon carved by the Colorado river, which wove under and beside us for hundreds of miles. I imagine future generations will look back in envy at the adventuresome 80-mile-an-hour curves between high, red rocks. Like we look back at the covered wagons, they'll look back at us from their autopiloted hover cars, their 800mph maglev trains, and think "how did they ever find the courage to pilot a vehicle on those old asphalt deathtraps!?"

It takes some concentration, we all know, to stay steady in the lanes over those long distances. It was more than a little exhilirating.

We made frequent use of scenic road-side pull-off rest stops, since they offered such lovely views of canyons and riverbanks. At one, a lone merchant pedaled dream-catchers. At another, we met a nice, older couple headed from Maryland to a wedding in San Diego: a talkative woman and her shy companion in a white fedora. We took their picture for them, and then took a few for ourselves, our legs dangling over the littlest cliff accessible from the path.

I think I am done making word pictures of the landscape. I have run out of words. Rocks and sand. Hills and buttes. Bluffs and mesas. In every combination of colors from green, to white, to lobster orange. At every scale from head-height, to high-rise, to the gargantuan monuments whose walls seem to stretch thousands of vertical feet, or cause the very sky to appear filled with earth, as though we were looking down at another planet--complete with fields, barns, houses--just tangent to ours, other earths grafted at 15 degrees to ours that we might reach in a home-made rocket.

The terrain out here in Utah and western Colorado is beyond human scale. And as such, it has escaped human development. There may be other factors at play, too.

While we first listened to a chapter of "American Nations," an urbane, ontological declaration of the alleged eleven separate cultural "nations" comprising the body politic of America, the book we settled on for the long hours was "The Worst Hardest Time," a very intimate history of both the settling of the high plains, and the subsequent dustbowl which decimated their society. It follows the broad trends and headlines of the era, but primarily makes use of certain individual settlers, cowboys, and merchants as exemplars of their class including, even, snippets of dialogue that I hope are taken from diaries or else would seem to be pretty egregious artistic license.

We made an online order at a mom and pop diner from the road, and picked up our dinners on the way in to the hotel. Right around then we called Lyle at the mechanics' and got the best news we could've asked for (well, the news we *did* ask for): the rig'll be ready on time! So we ate our dinner with light hearts and the last act of the adaptation of Crichton's "Timeline" playing on HBO. Absolute medieval chaos only incidentally involving John Cleese.
