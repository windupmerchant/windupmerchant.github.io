Settled down, last night, into a gravelly campsite with a finicky spigot but 30 clean amperes of electrical power. It was dark, so we couldn't see much, but Sam made us cocoa while I fiddled with the hookups and stabilizer jacks. I never could get the rig level, though, and the next morning we had to back out of that so-called pull-through site because, by morning's light, we could see that the gravel path out was steep and deeply furrowed. We might have damaged the underside of our rig.

While I was back there, jacking up the back bumper, I took a look at the undercarriage and noted it was a bit jaunty. Not sure what to do with that information. I sat my denim-plated ass on the ground and gave the jaunty bits a few shoves of the boot, but nothing budged an inch. Those are the beams holding up our waste tanks, I recon. It'd be a real shame if they tumbled out on the road next time we took a few too many potholes at 60 miles and hour.

And we're bound to hit a few such rickety roads. The road from Needles to the Grand Canyon, I remember, was especially poor. And we're always in the right-hand "crawler" lane, as Sam's British vernacular would have it, where the roads are the worst.

We are leaving Santa Fe, and Sam has just shut off the engine overdrive, a move typical for climbing steep grades.

"We have a headwind," he explains.

Before pulling into our uneven gravel site at *Rancheros De Santa Fe*, we'd gorged ourselves on some Santa Fe-vorites at the famous Plaza Cafe, right there on eponymous square in the spiritual center of town. Sam had himself a Hatch Green Chile burger, and I had some blue corn tortilla enchiladas. We ordered a chicken-stuffed sopapilla--sauced "Christmas," half in red chile salsa, half of green--but were too stuffed ourselves to touch it--and thought it'd make a premium breakfast.

Luckily, my enchiladas came with an exemplar of the sopapilla on the side: eaten hot, drizzled with honey, big as your splayed hand and plenty wide enough to share. Sam and I took turns stripping chunks off it, smearing them across the honeyed paper. Words cannot describe the nostalgic satisfaction of chewing on a hot, airy sopapilla. I don't even know when I had one last. I don't even think I had them *every* time we came to Santa Fe to visit grandpa. And yet, ordering one felt like a necessity, this time around. In fact, it's why we'd come to the Plaza. We had searched for "best sopapillas in Santa Fe" and found them on the list.

We hadn't planned on visiting the Plaza, specifically, but we came across it while browsing the (mostly closed) shops downtown. My eyes never grow tired of looking at adobe buildings. I've always a thirst to see them, and they never disappoint. Is there a city ordinance that demands the rounded stucco and exposed beam-end style? It must be a fairly abstract one, since many of the exposed beams have been sensibly replaced with gutter spouts. Even the most pedestrian of buildings, like a hospital or apartment complex, are done up in the Santa Fe style. Where else can you see that?

There's plenty of kitsch to be found meandering the plaza. It's probably 95% kitsch, if I'm being honest, but it's a comfort to me. After nearly two weeks of strangeness, coming to Santa Fe was a little like coming home. I only wish we'd made time to visit grandpa's old house but we only got in just in time for dinner, and then it was dark.

We'd traveled a long way, that afternoon--through Hopi and Navajo lands from Michael's little off-grid plot on the outskirts of Williams, Arizona--stopping only to look at Kachina's and buy some dreamcatchers. The Kachina dolls in the roadside gift shops were massive, though. Not at all the hand-sized figures I'd hoped to mount on the dashboard. And, besides, I know too little about the people (spirits?) they represent. Ganesh or St. Christopher, I know, take especial care of travelers, and carrying charitable tsedakah is said to ward off Sheydim, but who are the eagle-headed dancers? The one with black-and-white stripes all up their arms and legs, or whose eyes bulge out like adobe beams from either side of their nose? Who are they, what do they want, and what attitude would they have about our trundling rig?
