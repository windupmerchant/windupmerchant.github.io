I may have to be brief, this morning, as I am suffering a bit from last night's rap session around the campfire turning into a bit of a bender, with Natural Ice beers readily supplied by the proprietor of the Little Oasis campground--an acre of dry scrubland marked out into plots by dotted lines of white stones, each adorned with twisting scupltures of dry branches and some with pergolas of the same material, and metal fire pits.

Joe brought 'round a wheelbarrow of rough-hewn firewood that smelled great, burning, and handed us each a pair of canned beers before heading off on another job. We jacked the back end of the rig for stabilization, lit a fire in the pit and then Sam boiled potatoes and heated up some packets of curried lentils while I busted out the saxophone and played a few riffs on "Bye-Bye, Blackbird" and the old King Kraken hits "Elastic Girl" and that vaguely reggae-sounding one that always puts me in mind of a pulsar star, or a blinking lighthouse. I found myself playing a lick from "Cherokee" once or twice, too, before ending on "Blackbird," which I started to do every time I noodled like this during quarantine, then perched out the window, or standing on the roof.

We had arrived at the Grand Canyon around four in the afternoon, and it was pretty crowded. Roughly half of everyone were wearing masks, but it was easy to keep a social distance by dodging around trees, and off paths--which, for my health, I try to do as much as possible, and have for years.

The canyon is big. You've got to see it for yourself.

The amenities were, historically, constructed by the CCC: the Civilian Conservation Corps, an organization with which Sam and I'd become familiar through mention in "The Worst Hard Time" of their soil preservation efforts at the end of the dustbowl era. FDR's man--Bennett, I believe--had sent plenty of fresh, underemployed CCC youths out to toil on the plains planting trees and such. This was, apparently, later found to be unconstitutional, but they managed also to string a telephone line across the Grand Canyon before they were broken up.

The drive out from Needles was largely uneventful. We finished listening to "The Worst Hard Time" and after a brief, unsatisfying dalliance with "Blues Traveler" I threw on some "Crosby, Stills & Nash" whose vocal harmonies are both exceedingly pleasant, and occupy a Hz band that's not interfered with by rushing wind and engine tones.
