We woke up in the Smokies, yesterday, and made a liesurely morning of it. Then we went for a walk in the woods. It was nice. Then it was cold, but still exhilirating. Then it was cold, and too cold, and even though we took shelter from the wind by hunkering down in the restored relic of a watchtower we didn't dally. That was the peak of Mount Cammerer, I believe. Some 4,900 feet, half of which we'd walked from our site at Cosby Campground.

The trail to the watchtower--not a watchtower, technically, in that it wasn't raised above the trees by stilts of any kind but, rather, sat directly on a ground which just happened to raise itself above the trees, being a peak--was less than a mile's offshoot of the Appalachian, which we'd hiked a bit of to reach it, and so we encountered several through-hikers while we were out there.

"Georgia to Maine?" Sam would ask.

"Yup!" they'd breathlessly proclaim, "Georgia to Maine!"

Then they'd ask us where we were coming from, and when we told them it was Cosby Campground, a mere five miles back, they'd appear'd a little crestfallen. Not through-hikers, after all, we were only day-hikers.

Still, they're an odd lot, through-hikers. What kind of personality does it take to commit oneself to weeks of grueling solitude?

We encountered one couple who, when they reached us in the defunct watchtower, expressed a puzzling dismay over it. The man walked in, strode right over the buckling beams from which I'd shied away, took in some 360 degrees of it and declared the place "interesting."

Then his girlfriend walked in and said, in the exact same tone, that she found it "interesting" as well. Then the two of them agreed it was a disappointment, not what they'd expected. Not what they'd hoped for. They were some few hours out from their destination, we'd learned from an earlier conversation on the trail. Were they hoping for plugs? That's what one trekker told us she was most excited to encounter at the hostel some ten miles on. She was a fan--she told us, apropos of nothing--of the "dollar ninety nine poncho," and indeed she was wearing such a poncho, and trash-bags about her legs.

Another hiker was wearing shorts. "Nice weather for shorts," he remarked, as we passed him. Oddly self-conscious lot, through-hikers. I guess maybe you get that way when you're on your own for so long, just yourself, the maples, the rocks and the salamanders.

We did not see any salamanders. We looked. We took good hard looks at several pools and clear streams, but saw nothing in the animal kingdom. There were little interpretive signs, along one short trail by the campsite, detailing the 30-odd unique species of salamander, but we didn't see a single one. Perhaps it's too early in the season for them. It was sunny, but brisk at the campsite and blowing snow across the peaks.

It grew gradually colder as we ascended, first with little sprinkles of rain, then bits of hail. We started seeing the hail gathering in crevices, and later noticed soft snow coming down. I think that was just after we'd passed the two young men in khakis digging rain-lets off the side of the trail. Eventually, the snow was collecting on leaves, and on the trail, and by the time we got to the peak we were tramping through two or so inches of the stuff, fresh beneath our boots. No one had gone that way, that morning. We were the first, since the snow, to reach the watchtower atop Mt. Cammerer.

When we got there, we had our lunch. Sam, a tuna/mayonnaise sandwich, and myself a thoroughly adulterated tuna salad, with relish, celery, and parsley making up an equal part. We split a packet of peanuts, had some fresh and dried fruit, and would've set in on the beef jerkey if our fingers weren't growing numb, then.

I ran out of water just a mile or so before we got back to the campsite. It was fine, really. I was well and thoroughky hydrated by then, and stayed so for hours into the evening. I've got a three liter waterpack, and having drunk it all I had to stop several times on the trail to release some.

When we returned to the campsite, we were both quite sore and tired. I threw a can of soup on the stove, and multiplied its volume with one full can of coconut milk and another of cubed tomatoes. Beside that I tossed a can of green beens and garbanzo beans into a bagged salad dressed with a bottle of uninspiring "Italian" fluid and we got halfway through it all before falling asleep, Sam in his bed and me on the couch beside the dinette, since it was too full of food to fold down into my bed.

We ran the heater, but it wasn't quite warm enough, so eventually I did crawl into a sleeping bag, which I then wore more-or-less all evening.

After a nap, I finished the soup and salad while Sam polished off his pasta from the previous night. It was a relaxed evening, long hours of reading, gazing out windows, hot tea, contemplating birds. We combed through our devices for downloaded movies, but it was just as well we found none, because we'd brought all this paper media along!
